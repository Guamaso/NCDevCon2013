Standards Talk by Bilal Soylu

The very next second after you've written your code, it is outdated...

So true.

Book: JS The good parts by Douglass Crockford

**IDE's let you write code faster, but you're only writing code ~20% of the time.**

The remaining time is understanding and debugging existing code.

###Good style can help reduce the occurence of errors

###All things equal, Determin a convention and follow it. GLOBALLY.

###Use forms that are error resistant.

###Write code for PEOPLE (composition technique counts!)

* Less lines of code isn't always better.
* Use moar white space, indentation, etc
* Be NEAT!
* "Don't be a jerk"
* `++` operator was created for memory pointer allocation?
* `B = B + 1` is easier to read. Stop using `++`/`--`
* **One liners are fast but error prone and hard to read.**

[ ] Set up a code writing style guide for my personal projects

###If there is a feature of a language that is sometimes problematic... (missed the rest)

* basically, don't use potential confusing constructs/patterns/etc
* Case statements, if missing a `break` goes into the very next case, even if the conditional is not met! (Demoed in JS) WTF.

###It hardly ever happens == IT HAPPENS

* If it "hardly ever happens" then don't effing do it.

###Avoid forms that are difficult to distinguish from common errors

###Choose variable names that indiciate errors.

* Especially JS (weakly typed)
* Namesspacing?
* Variable scope and hoisting rules in JS. Read it. Know it. Live IT.

###Write in the language you are writing for.

###Write in a way that clearly communicates INTENT

* COMMENT. A LOT.
* Document your code. Define functions, variables, etc at the very top next to title comment block.
* Follow a style/naming convention.
* API naming/structure? Include the entire team.

###Choose names wisely.

###Drive down *error rates* not keystrokes.

###Designing a programming standard demands discipline
